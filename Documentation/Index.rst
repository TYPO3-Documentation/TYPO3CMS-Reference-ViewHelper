This is a complete reference of all available :ref:`Fluid <t3coreapi:fluid>`
view helpers in the TYPO3 Core.

Fluid is a PHP template engine and is the de facto standard for any
HTML-based output in the TYPO3 CMS. However, it is not dependent on
TYPO3 and can be used in any PHP project. See the :doc:`Fluid standalone
documentation <other_typo3fluid:Index>`.

*Note:* This documentation was `generated <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/fluid-documentation-generator>`__
from the PHP source code of TYPO3.
